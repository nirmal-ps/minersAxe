There will be payouts reaching the client wallet after 48 hours and after that reaching on a daily basis.</p><p>Remark: Every day of mining will be processed and paid in the following 24 hours after the mining day is over.</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin and altcoin mining depend highly on the prices and difficulties of the coins you mine. It would not “look right” if we provide data on the mining profitability and selling contracts at the same time. Therefore, we recommend all our clients to do their own research and do their own profitability calculation.</p>
                    <p>For example, you might want to have a look at coinwarz.com. Remember that some of our products have a daily maintenance fee, and this must be deducted from the daily earnings.Please note that the website is an independent source of reference and not related to MinersAxe Mining in any way.</p>

                   <p>On the first glance, one might think that buying miner X is slightly cheaper than hosted mining. However, there are a number of "hidden" costs related to purchasing and maintaining a miner that change the economics significantly:</p>
                   <p>Shipping costs: few merchants will cover this, but in most cases, they will charge you extra.Customs dues / VAT: if it is an international delivery you will likely have to pay customs dues and VAT; generally this has a huge impact on the total cost of your mining equipment.Delivery time: when you pay for your device you have to wait until the miner is packaged and shipped; if it is held up in the customs this can take weeks. And during that time you cannot mine at all ("opportunity costs"). You have to wait and hope. And if the merchant has a stock shortage; it is you who has to wait. With MinersAxe you pay and get your hashpower immediately online. No delays!</p>
                   <p>Costs for additional equipment: when buying miners from larger retailers you often have to buy additional equipment like an extra PSU that matches the electricity specs for your country, control units and specific shelves to store them efficiently. This adds up significantly to the overall price for hashpower.Setting the system up: when the device finally arrived you have to assemble and configure it. Beginners often underestimate the amount of work and technical knowledge that is needed to bring the device up and optimize its settings. People that used the first ASICs spend days and weeks on it. In monetary terms this costs you twice: (i) your time and (ii) lost mining opportunity.Maintenance: hardware failures, outages and crashes could lead to downtimes between seconds and weeks. If your unit breaks you have to return it and start from scratch (by the way: check the guarantee time of your miner; it is often less than a year). With MinersAxe you have a guaranteed uptime of 100%: in case one of your units fails another unit will be switched over and start mining for you the very same second.</p>
                   <p>Electricity: having the machines at home not only brings heat and noise, but also an increase of your electricity bill; an important factor that many underestimates.Please do not get us wrong: we do not want to discourage anyone from mining at home! We are often asked about prices and realized that many users do not know about all the hidden costs. If you compare the true costs, you will notice that our prices are very competitive. We want to provide you the best possible mining experience, so that you can focus on mining your favorite coins (and we take care of the rest).</p>

                   <p>MinersAxe Mining provides daily payouts of all mined coins!</p>
                   <p>A mining day usually starts at 00:00 UTC and ends at 23:59:59 UTC. If you just bought a contract the start time could be different and you will only mine for a fraction of that day. Otherwise your miners will mine for you 24 hours and exactly act according to your settings (see “mining allocation”).</p>
                   <p>At the end of the 24 hours mining day we will do some additional calculations and double checks to ensure everything is correct. About 8 hours later (max. 24 hours) you will receive payouts for each coin you have mined. Please ensure that you provide a payout address for each coin you mine, otherwise we cannot make the payout!</p>
                   <p>It can take up to 48 hours to receive the first payout once you have purchased a contract. If you did not get any payouts from us within 48 hours, please contact our customer service team at info@mineraxe.com.</p>
                   <p>When you order via credit card, your payouts will be held for a month, as stated in the Terms of the Contract. This is a security measure to protect MinersAxe from credit card charge back. Once the month has passed, the full amount will be released to your wallet, and from then on you will receive a daily payout.In the meantime you can see your accumulated earnings in My Account >My Orders, under "My pending balance of payouts".You can check your general payouts in the menu in the menu under “Payouts”.</p>
